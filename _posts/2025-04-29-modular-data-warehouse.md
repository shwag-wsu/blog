## üåê Cloud-Agnostic Modern Data Warehouse Architecture (ELT)

This architecture outlines a flexible, scalable ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) approach that supports multiple cloud platforms ‚Äî AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It separates data ingestion, storage, transformation, modeling, governance, and analytics, while promoting modularity and vendor neutrality.

### üîß Modular Data Warehouse Reference Architecture

### 1. Sources
- File-based: Google Sheets, Excel, CSVs
- Internal DBs: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- SaaS: Salesforce, HubSpot

### 2. Data Ingestion
Data is ingested into the pipeline using both batch and streaming mechanisms:

<b>Batch Processing:</b> Regular scheduled jobs to pull from sources.

<b>Pub/Sub or Event Streams:</b> For real-time data (e.g., user activity, app logs).

#### Key Considerations:

Data is validated at ingestion for schema correctness, null values, and basic formatting.

Real-time and batch pipelines can coexist based on latency needs.

#### Cloud Options

Component             | AWS                   | Azure                    | GCP
--------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------
Batch Process         | AWS Glue              | Azure Data Factory       | Cloud Dataflow
Pub/Sub               | Amazon Kinesis        | Event Grid / Service Bus | Google Pub/Sub


### 3. Data Lake
Stores raw or lightly processed data in its native format (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured).

Typically uses object storage (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Blob).

Organizes data using folders or table-like structures (e.g., Delta Lake, Iceberg).

<b>Purpose:</b>

Acts as a staging area before transformation.

Enables data reprocessing, historical audit, and exploration by data scientists.

#### Cloud Options

Component             | AWS                   | Azure                    | GCP
--------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------
Storage               | S3                    | Azure Blob               | Google Cloud Storage
Database              | Snowflake             | Event Grid / Service Bus | Google Pub/Sub


### 4. Transformation Layer (ELT)
Transformations happen after loading into the lake or warehouse.


Logic: Joins, filters, aggregation, and business rule enforcement.

<b>Benefits:</b>
 - Scales better with cloud-native warehouses.
 - Version-controlled transformations improve governance.
 - Allows unit tests and CI/CD for data logic.
 - Data quality layer

#### Tool Options

Tools                                                           |
-------------------------------------------------------------   |
dbt,Apache Spark, SQL scripts, or data orchestration frameworks |

### 5. Data Warehouse (EDW)
A performant, query-optimized environment where cleansed and transformed data lives.

<b>Use Case:</b>

- Business Intelligence dashboards
- Ad hoc reporting and advanced analytics
- Ensures data consistency and performance

#### Tool Options

Component             | AWS                   | Azure                    | GCP
--------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------
Data Warehouse        |  Redshift	          | Synapse	                 | BigQuery
Vendor-Neutral	      |  Snowflake (multi-cloud)	


### 6. Data Model

Modeled using dbt, SQL Views, or Semantic Layers

Stored in the warehouse for BI tools to consume



### 7. Security & Governance 

<b>Authentication/Authorization:</b> OAuth2, SAML, role-based access control

<b>Data Quality:</b> Tools like Great Expectations, dbt tests, or custom scripts

<b>Compliance:</b> GDPR, HIPAA, SOX enforced via access logs, audit trails, masking

<b>Purpose:</b>

- Ensures trust and compliance
- Supports enterprise risk management initiatives

### 8. Visualization & Analytics

Business users, analysts, and data scientists consume the data via BI tools:

<b>Dashboards:</b> Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Metabase

<b>Exploration:</b> SQL Notebooks, Jupyter, Mode Analytics

<b>APIs:</b> For downstream systems or machine learning models

<b>Purpose:</b>

- Unlock business insights
- Drive data-informed decisions

#### Tools Options
