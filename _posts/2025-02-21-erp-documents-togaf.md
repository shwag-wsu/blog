TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) provide a structured approach to enterprise architecture. The ERP documentation framework can align well with TOGAF and ADM, particularly in ensuring consistency, traceability, and alignment with business objectives.

## Mapping Your ERP Documentation to TOGAF ADM Phases

### 1. Preliminary Phase – Establishing Architecture Capability

#### [ERP Governance Framework](./documentation-erp.html#erp-governance-framework)
Defines roles, responsibilities, and governance models for ERP architecture within the organization.
Ensures alignment with enterprise-wide IT governance.

### 2. Architecture Vision – High-Level Planning

#### [Business Requirements Document (BRD)](./documentation-erp.html#business-requirements-document-(brd))
Captures high-level business needs and objectives, aligning with the Architecture Vision phase.

#### [User Requirements Document (URS)](./documentation-erp.html#user-requirements-document-(urs))
Defines key user expectations for the ERP system, influencing early architecture decisions.

### 3. Business Architecture – Defining Business Processes

#### Business Process Maps
Aligns with TOGAF’s Business Architecture phase by mapping key ERP-related workflows.

#### End-to-End Process Documentation (O2C, P2P, R2R, etc.)
Provides detailed business process descriptions critical for defining ERP functionalities.

#### Change Management Plans
Supports organizational change strategies as new ERP components are introduced.

### 4. Information Systems Architecture – Application & Data Design

#### System Requirements Specification (SRS)
Captures functional and non-functional requirements for the ERP application layer.

#### System Design Specification (SDS)
Supports ERP application architecture and database structure definitions.

#### Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
Aligns with the Data Architecture domain by documenting how data moves within and beyond the ERP system.

### 5. Technology Architecture – Infrastructure & Security

#### Technical Architecture Document (TAD)
Provides infrastructure details, aligning with TOGAF’s Technology Architecture phase.
#### Architectural Integration Map (AIM)
Documents system integrations and dependencies across the ERP ecosystem.

#### Interface Requirements Specification (IRS)
Defines integration points with external applications and legacy systems.

### 6. Opportunities & Solutions – Planning Implementation
#### System Validation & Testing Documentation
Ensures ERP components are validated before deployment.
#### Incident & Risk Management Procedures
Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies for ERP deployment.

### 7. Migration Planning – Roadmap for Deployment

#### Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans (BCP/DRP)
Ensures ERP availability during transitions and system failures.

#### Regulatory Change Impact Assessments
Addresses compliance risks associated with ERP updates or migrations.

### 8. Implementation Governance – Compliance & Execution

#### Access Control & User Management Policies
Ensures ERP access controls align with governance and security best practices.

#### Audit & Compliance Reports (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
Provides documentation for ERP security, audit trails, and regulatory compliance.

### 9. Architecture Change Management – Continuous Improvement

#### Error Handling & Troubleshooting Guides
Supports ongoing maintenance and issue resolution post-implementation.

#### Training Manuals & Administrative Guides
Ensures continuous knowledge transfer and user enablement.
