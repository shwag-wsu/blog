### Business Documents (Blueprints, Business Requirement Documents)
Business documentation is essential for defining the objectives, requirements, and scope of an ERP system. These documents serve as the foundation for system design, development, and implementation by capturing key business needs and aligning them with technical solutions.

#### Business Requirements Document (BRD)
A high-level document that outlines the business objectives, key requirements, and expected outcomes of the ERP system. It serves as a communication tool between business stakeholders and technical teams to ensure alignment.

#### User Requirements Document (URS)
A more detailed document focusing on specific user needs, functionalities, and system behaviors. It defines how users will interact with the ERP and what capabilities they require to perform their tasks efficiently.

These documents ensure that ERP implementations meet business goals, comply with industry regulations, and provide a structured approach to system development and deployment.

### Technical Documents (Architecture Diagrams, Integration Specs)
Technical documentation provides a blueprint for ERP system design, architecture, and integrations. These documents ensure that the system is scalable, secure, and meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

#### System Design Specification (SDS)
A comprehensive document detailing the overall architecture, database structure, system components, and interactions between different ERP modules.

#### Interface Requirements Specification (IRS) 
Defines how the ERP system interacts with external systems, including APIs, data formats, and integration protocols.

#### System Requirements Specification (SRS) 
Captures functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, security, and usability expectations.

#### Technical Architecture Document (TAD) 
Provides an in-depth look at the technology stack, infrastructure, networking, and security considerations.

#### Architectural Integration Map (AIM) 
A visual representation of data flows, system integrations, and dependencies, helping architects and developers understand ERP connectivity.

Technical documents are vital for developers, architects, and IT teams to ensure seamless ERP implementation and maintenance.

### Process Documents (Workflows, SOPs)
Process documentation ensures that business workflows within the ERP system are well-defined, standardized, and optimized for efficiency. These documents help organizations maintain consistency in operations and provide clarity for users and stakeholders.

#### Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
Step-by-step procedural guides for executing business operations within the ERP system.

#### Business Process Maps
Visual workflows that outline how different departments interact with the ERP system to complete tasks.

#### Change Management Plans
Documentation that outlines the procedures for handling updates, system changes, and user adaptations to minimize disruptions.

#### Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
A structured way to visualize how data moves between ERP modules and external systems.

#### End-to-End Process Documentation (O2C, P2P, R2R, etc.)
Comprehensive guides covering full lifecycle processes such as Order-to-Cash (O2C), Procure-to-Pay (P2P), and Record-to-Report (R2R).

#### Role-Based Process Guides
Documentation tailored to specific user roles, ensuring that employees understand their responsibilities within the ERP system.

These documents are essential for process optimization, training, compliance, and ensuring ERP adoption across an organization.

### User Documentation (Training Manuals, FAQs, Troubleshooting)
User documentation is critical for ensuring that end-users, administrators, and support teams can effectively operate and troubleshoot the ERP system. This section provides resources that help users navigate the system, perform tasks efficiently, and resolve common issues.

#### Training Manuals
Step-by-step guides for performing tasks within the ERP system, often used for onboarding new users or training existing staff on system updates.

#### Administrative Guides
Detailed instructions for system administrators, covering user management, system configurations, and administrative controls.

#### Error Handling & Troubleshooting Guides 
Documentation outlining common ERP errors, their causes, and step-by-step resolutions to help users and support teams address problems efficiently.

#### FAQs
A collection of commonly asked questions and answers to help users quickly find solutions to frequent issues.


### Governance & Compliance (Audit Logs, Security Policies)
Governance and compliance documentation ensures that the ERP system adheres to regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal security policies. These documents help organizations manage risk, maintain audit readiness, and enforce accountability within the ERP ecosystem.

#### ERP Governance Framework
Defines roles, responsibilities, and decision-making structures for ERP system ownership and management. It includes policies on system updates, data integrity, and compliance oversight.

#### Access Control & User Management Policies
Outlines role-based access controls (RBAC), segregation of duties (SoD), and user authentication protocols to ensure data security.

#### Audit & Compliance Reports (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
Documentation required for regulatory compliance, covering financial controls, data privacy, and security policies.

#### Data Retention & Archival Policies 
Establishes guidelines on how long ERP data should be retained, archived, and securely deleted based on legal and business requirements.

#### Incident & Risk Management Procedures
Provides structured response plans for security incidents, breaches, and other risk events affecting the ERP system.

#### System Validation & Testing Documentation
Ensures that the ERP meets regulatory and operational requirements through structured testing and validation processes.

#### Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans (BCP/DRP)
Defines strategies and procedures to maintain ERP functionality in case of system failures, cyberattacks, or natural disasters.

#### Regulatory Change Impact Assessments
Documents the potential impact of changing regulations on the ERP system and outlines necessary updates to maintain compliance.
These documents are essential for IT governance teams, compliance officers, and auditors to ensure that the ERP system is secure, reliable, and aligned with legal and industry mandates.
