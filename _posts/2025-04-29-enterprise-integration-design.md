This design outlines a flexible, scalable integration design approach that supports hybrid clouds. This design levelages a hub and spoke design and does not address point to point integrations.

- Layered design promotes reusability and clear separation of responsibilities.
- Pub/Sub Messaging ensures decoupling between producers and consumersâ€”scales well.
- Security & Governance layers show mature operational readiness.
- Support for hybrid cloud (on-prem + SaaS) integration.
- Inclusion of Boomi and Workato in orchestration offers flexibility for integration use cases.

## Pub /Sub Messaging


### Pub/Sub Message Standards (Loop Protection)
 {% highlight json %}
 {
  "messageId": "uuid-12345-abc",
  "source_system": "workday",
  "processed_by": ["workato", "boomi"],
  "timestamp": "2025-04-29T10:00:00Z",
  "event": {
    "type": "employee.updated",
    "payload": {...}
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


#### Loop Prevention Strategy

 - processed_by is an array of systems that have handled the message.
 - Each subscriber checks this field before acting.
 - Systems append their ID to the list if not present.
 - Optionally enforce max hop count or TTL to further prevent endless retries.

## Message Layer
### Purpose
Facilitates asynchronous communication between systems using a publish/subscribe model.

### Components
- **Publisher**: Publishes data events to the message bus.
- **Subscribers**: Consume relevant messages based on topic or event type.

### Key Considerations
- Use unique `messageId` for deduplication and traceability.
- Include `source_system` and `processed_by` metadata in messages.
- Implement logic to prevent message reprocessing or infinite loops.
- Support for retries, dead-letter queues, and idempotent subscribers.

### Tech Stack Examples
- Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, AWS SNS/SQS, RabbitMQ

## Orchestration Layer

### Purpose
Coordinates business workflows and integration processes using automation platforms.

### Components
- **Workato Recipes**: No-code/low-code flows optimized for business users.
- **Boomi Flows**: Enterprise-grade, scalable workflows for complex integrations.

### Responsibilities
- Execute business logic across systems.
- Manage sequencing, conditional logic, error handling.

### Best Practices
- Design modular flows for reuse.
- Include fallback and alerting mechanisms.

## Consistency Layer

### Purpose
Ensures data consistency across systems via polling or event-driven techniques.

### Components
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Tracks real-time data changes.
- **Polling**: Periodic checks for data changes in non-event sources.

### Best Practices
- Prefer CDC for low-latency and efficient change detection.
- Use timestamp or checkpoint-based polling to reduce load.

## Security and Governance Layer

### Purpose
Enforces policies around authentication, data protection, and compliance.

### Components
- **Authentication/Authorization**: OAuth2, SAML, OpenID
- **Encryption**: Transit (TLS/SFTP), At-rest (PGP)
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys, tokens
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive data obfuscation

### Governance Inclusions
- Centralized audit trail and logging
- Enforcement of access controls

## Governance Layer

### Purpose
Supports transparency, traceability, and maintainability of integration flows.

### Components
- **Logging**: Centralized log management for observability.
- **Audit Trail**: Change tracking for compliance.
- **Reusable Components**: Common connectors, transformation scripts, validation routines.

### Standards
- Use correlation IDs across logs for traceability.
- Enforce logging policies for all components.
