Since ERP systems manage critical business operations, securing them should be a top priority. By following these security best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, fraud, and unauthorized access while ensuring regulatory compliance.

You can futher tailor these security recommendations for a specific ERP platform (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, Workday) but these the highlevel once I typically like to follow.


### Identity & Access Management (IAM)

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

- Implement least privilege access â€“ users should only have access to what they need.
- Define granular roles and permissions in the ERP.
- Regularly audit and review access privileges.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

Enforce MFA for all users, especially admin and privileged accounts.
Use Azure AD Conditional Access for additional security layers.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO):

Integrate SSO using Azure AD, Okta, or another identity provider.
Reduces credential sprawl and improves user experience.

#### Privileged Account Management (PAM):

Use Just-in-Time (JIT) access for admin accounts.
Monitor and log all privileged account actions.



### Data Security & Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest & In Transit:

Use AES-256 encryption for database storage.
Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all communications between services.
Ensure ERP backups are encrypted and stored securely.
Ensure any files used in integrations are also encrypted at rest

#### Data Masking & Tokenization:

Use data masking for sensitive data (PII, PHI, financial info).
Tokenization can help protect sensitive customer and financial data.
#### Database Security:

Implement row-level security (RLS) and column-level security (CLS).
Restrict direct database access to only authorized applications/services.
Regular database vulnerability scans and security patches.
